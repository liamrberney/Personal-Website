                               I'm a Junior Honors Computer Science student with a minor in Cybersecurity. I'm also a violist in the Aggie Orchestra and 
                               a lumberjack for Aggie Bonfire. I've taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms, Programming Languages, Computer Design,
                               Discrete Math, Cybersecurity Law, Multivariate Calculus, and Statistics, and 
                               I'm currently taking Introduction to Operating Systems, Analysis of Algorithms, and Programming studio 
                               as a part of my coursework. 
                            </p>

                                I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and I've been interested in computers pretty much all my life, getting kicked off the living room tax-machine for as long as I can remember.
                                When I was 13, I saved enough money to buy the parts to build my very own computer, and I was on it constantly, tinkering with the machine.
                                In the meantime, I spent most of my time at school waiting until programming or robotics club would start, and was finally able to do
                                Computer Science for real once I got to college. 
                            </p>

                                In terms of work experience, I've worked as a lifeguard, cashier, and most recently as a Software Engineering Intern at Triple-S Steel.
                                I learned a lot while I was there, like how to write code in C#, frameworks like ASP.NET Model-View-Controller, and how to interact with
                                clients during a Software project. I experienced maintaining and improving other people's code, as well as designing programs and writing my own.
                                I got to talk to users about the projects I was working on and make changes based on that feedback, and I loved being thanked for the changes I made,
                                or the tool I wrote to make someone's job a little bit easier.
                                And while I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with the rest of my career, I've become fairly skilled with relational databases,
                                and am planning on working in Data Science once I graduate.
